  [ Guido Günther ]
  * util: Fix copyright header.
    Fixes: e8d3fa8 ("treewide: Use consistent copyright headers")
  * packaging: Update package descriptions
  * README: Mention that we can be used as a shared lib
  * build-howto: Explain how to use as a shared library
  * build: Don't use str for boolean argument. This is deprecated in meson
  * ci: No need to remove lcov anymore
  * ci: Use build dependencies. Instead of open coding these use what we have
    in packaging
  * ci: Add workaround for broken gcovr in Debian.
    See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1070172
  * ci: Add style checks
  * packaging: Handle nocheck
  * packaging: Handle nodoc
  * packaging: Ignore package dirs
  * build: Prefer '/' over join_paths()
  * data: Introduce udev rules and hwdb to track wakeup keys.
    On phones and tablets the only key that should usually unidle a device
    is the power button while other exposed hardware keys like the volume
    buttons shouldn't e.g. take the device out of idle / unblank the screen.
    Allow to specify whether an input device has wakeup keys (default is
    1) and to specify whether individual keys on that device are wakeup
    keys or not. E.g.
    gmobile:…
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_DEFAULT=0
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_116=1
    would mark all keys on the matching input device as non-wakeup keys
    with the exception of the power button. This would be a typical setting
    for phones. Whereas on a convertible that has a single keyboard device
    containing both the exposed volume keys as well as the regular input
    keys
    gmobile:…
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_114=0
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_115=0
    would allow all keys to unidle the device except for the exposed volume
    rocker.
    See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/32261 for details
    Device tree devices can't match via dmi modalias. The corresponding
    thing there is the DT compatible. Allow to match by the most specific
    part of the device tree compatible. This allows to e.g. match the volume
    keys on a Librem 5 like:
      gmobile:name:gpio-keys:dt:purism,librem5*
    matching on a specific model would look like
      gmobile:name:gpio-keys:dt:purism,librem5r4
    See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/32362 for details
  * data/hwdb: Add wakeup keys for the Librem 11 tablet
  * data/hwdb: Add wakeup keys for the Librem 5 phone
  * doc: Add manpage explaining the hwdb entries.
    This text based on parts of the libinput documentation.

  * data/hwdb: Add wakeup keys for the PinePhone beta
    based on outputs with postmarket-os edge gnome-mobile:
